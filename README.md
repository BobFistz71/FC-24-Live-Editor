### Welcome to the FC 24 Live Editor!

- [Changes in latest version of the tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xAranaktu/FC-24-Live-Editor/main/changelog.txt)
- [FC 24 Live Editor & Cheat Table Release Schedule](https://bit.ly/FC-24-Release-Schedule)
- Check [WIKI](https://github.com/xAranaktu/FC-24-Live-Editor/wiki) for Guides and Tutorials

My plans for Live Editor is to make all in one tool.
It's dedicated for single player manager career mode, but there are some dedicated features for player career mode too.
Modding, editing game memory, editing database, API for developers and many other features that you never dreamed about.

### Before you pledge on Patreon/buy the game
The game is protected with EA Anticheat. Using the tool may flag your account and EA may ban it later on.
You are using the tool at your own risk.

- This tool doesn't work online. You won't be able to connect with EA servers while using it. This is intended, and won't be "fixed".
- I can't guarantee for how long the tool will be working. EA may update the game at any time and since then it may be not possible to update the Live Editor to make it compatible with latest game update.


For now this tool allows you to:
- Mod almost **all** legacy files (add or replace)
- Edit Players
- Edit Database (only tables that are part of the squadfile)

If you don't know how to use tool, Check [Getting Started](https://github.com/xAranaktu/FC-24-Live-Editor/wiki/Getting-Started) Guide, [FAQ](https://github.com/xAranaktu/FC-24-Live-Editor/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions) and tutorials on the sidebar.
